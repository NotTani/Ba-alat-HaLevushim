teaching: Serach bat Asher is known in midrash as a wise, beautiful woman who is
  a skilled musician.  When Jacob's sons return from Egypt to inform their
  bereaved father that Joseph is still alive, they ask Serach to play her lyre
  (*kinor*) while singing sweetly to him, "my uncle Joseph is still
  alive."  Jacob is able to hear her message and his heart becomes joyful and
  the Spirit of God rests on him and he knows that this news is true.  He
  blesses Serach with eternal life.  Serach is the one person mentioned both at
  the beginning of the Exodus to Egypt and also upon leaving, so she is the one
  called upon to find Joseph's bones.
blessing: Serach offers the blessing of gentleness, sweetness, wisdom
