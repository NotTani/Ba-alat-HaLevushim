The **Great hornbill** (*Buceros bicornis*) also known as the **concave-casqued hornbill**, **great Indian hornbill** or **great pied hornbill**, is one of the larger members of the [hornbill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornbill "Hornbill") family. It is found in the [Indian subcontinent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent "Indian subcontinent") and [Southeast Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia "Southeast Asia"). Its impressive size and colour have made it important in many tribal cultures and rituals. The great hornbill is long-lived, living for nearly 50 years in captivity. It is predominantly frugivorous, but is an opportunist and will prey on small mammals, reptiles and birds.
